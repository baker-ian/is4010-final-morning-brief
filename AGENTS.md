# AI Agents Usage Log

## Tools Used
* **Gemini:** Used for project planning, debugging API 401 errors, generating code structure, and writing unit tests with `pytest-mock`.

## Development Process
1.  **Ideation:** I asked Gemini for project ideas suitable for a graduating senior. We settled on the "Morning Brief CLI" to demonstrate API integration and data persistence.
2.  **Implementation:**
    * Gemini provided the "Professional Package" folder structure.
    * Helped debug OpenWeatherMap API key activation delays.
    * Suggested using ESPN's public endpoints to avoid paid sports APIs.
3.  **Testing:**
    * Gemini explained how to use `pytest-mock` to test network calls without hitting the real API.
    * Helped configure the `.github/workflows/tests.yml` file for CI/CD.

## Reflection

### What worked well
* Gemini was very useful when it came to helping me determine the structure of my code and debugging errors.
* Gemini also worked very well when explaining how to use, implement, and troubleshoot issues with using API keys, which I had not done before this project.
* AI made creating documentation significantly easier and quicker.
### Challenges
* Had multiple issues with Gemini forgetting about responses it previously gave me, resulting in errors.
* Occasionally, code blocks with suggestions would not appear in the Gemini output, which caused confusion

### Learning Impact
* Using AI in a strategic manner made this project flow easier and greatly increased my learning through explanations.
* Some concepts used in the project were completely new to me, and Gemini's explanations made it much easier to understand what my code is doing.
